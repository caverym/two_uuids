# semi-Random UUID Generators

I made a UUID generator in Rust as an experiment and to expand my knowledge. Then decided to also write one in C. 

They're probably trash, but it works â€” I'm happy with their results.


To run, execute:
```sh
make
make run
```

And `make clean` to clean the sources.
